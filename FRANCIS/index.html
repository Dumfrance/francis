        <p> A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5 kg (2.2-3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7-11 kg (15-24 lb).</p>
            <p>All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the <em>Yorkshire terrier.</em> Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as <em>wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.</em></p>
            <P>It seems natural that you 'baby talk' to a puppy, but researchers have found that they actually respond to it! However, adult dogs could care less. </P>
            Different breeds of dogs have different sizes of litters( that's the number of puppies born at one time). Dogs that are older or smaller tend to have small litters, and dogs that are younger or larger tend to have bigger litters. The largest litter on record was 24 puppies, born to Tia- a Mastiff breed dog.
            <p>Congratulations!</p>
            <h2>HOW TO TRAIN YOUR PUPPY</h2>
            <p>When training is started at 7 to 8 weeks of age, use methods that rely on positive reinforcement and gentle teaching. Puppies have short attention spans, so training sessions should be brief, but should occur daily. Puppies can be taught to "sit", and "stand" using a method called food-lure training. </p>
            Small pieces of food or a favored toy can be used to motivate your puppy to perform most tasks. Provided the reward is sufficiently appealing, the puppy can be prompted to give the desired response by showing the puppy the reward, giving a command, and movin the reward to get te desired response. For example, food help up over the puppy's nose and moved slowly backwards should get a 'sit' response; food drawn down to the floor should get a 'down' response; food brought back up should get a 'stand' response; food held out at a distance should get a 'come' response; and food held at your thigh as you walk should get the puppy to'heel' or 'follow'.
